# Processing the data

In this section we examine how to process the raw data ready for analysis.

## Criminal Justice System Statistics

!!! warning "Data revision"

    The Ministry of Justice published revised outcomes by offence data for 2022
    in January 2024. This means that there are discrepancies observed in PRT's
    previously published Police Force Area factsheets, notably the number of women
    sentenced to a community sentence; suspended sentence; or immediate custody,
    with our 2022 edition under counting. This was not an error in our data analysis,
    but the result of the limitations with the raw dataset explained in the Ministry
    of Justice's (technical appendix)[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65a7e5feb2f3c60013e5d44b/criminal-justice-statistics-technical-appendix-june-2023.pdf#page=20].
