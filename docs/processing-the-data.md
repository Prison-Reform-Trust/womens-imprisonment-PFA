# Processing the data

In this section we examine how to process the raw data ready for analysis.

## Criminal Justice System Statistics



!!! warning "Data revision"

    The Ministry of Justice published [revised outcomes by offence data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justice-system-statistics-quarterly-december-2022) for 2022
    in January 2024. This means that there are discrepancies observed in PRT's
    previously published Police Force Area factsheets and the data produced in this edition. Our 2022 edition reports fewer women sentenced to a community sentence; suspended sentence; or immediate custody than in this edition. This was not an error in our data analysis, but the result of the limitations with the raw dataset explained in the Ministry of Justice's [technical appendix](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65a7e5feb2f3c60013e5d44b/criminal-justice-statistics-technical-appendix-june-2023.pdf#page=20). QA checks have been made using the datasets produced in this pipeline, with the filters used in both the revised and previous version of the outcomes by offence data tools.
